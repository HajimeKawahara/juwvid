This directory contains Fortran code for the 1D, 2D and 3D NUFFTs.

dirft*d.f contains direct evaluation schemes for verification/testing,
where * = 1,2,3

nufft*df90.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with dynamic F90 
workspace allocation.

nufft*df77.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with static F77 
workspace allocation in the calling (driver) routine.

next235.f contains a utility routine that finds a highly composite 
integer greater than a given number. 

dfftpack.f contains a double precision FFT package from Netlib.

nufft*d_demof77.f contains a sample driver routine for the F77
versions of the codes. 

nufft*d_demof90.f contains the analogous driver for the F90
versions of the codes.
